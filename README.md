# Kaloriee
This project is made for MLH- Waffle Hack weekly hackathon. It is made using HTML, CSS, bootstrap, and js.
It shows the total optimum intake of calories by a person using his/her age, height, and weight.
This project is inspired by one of our collegemate's health condition who got to know she lacks protein in her body with respect to other people of her age. It inspired us to check whether we can calculate the optimum need for various nutrients by our body and take care of our meals by that as it becomes impossible to have a healthy diet with hostel mess food.
This website calculates the optimum amount of fat, protein, and carbs needed by a healthy body based on age, weight, and height. It will help to take care of the daily needs of our body, especially for students like us who do not have options apart from mess food.
Though this project is in its beginner stage; we will try our best to add more features.
